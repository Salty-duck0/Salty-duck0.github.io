                <p>Hi! I'm <a class="main-links" href="mailto:nitishsingla1159@gmail.com" target="_blank">Nitish
                        Singla</a>.</p>
                <p>I am an undergrad at University of Delhi studying Information Technology and Mathematical Innovation.
                    Right now, I am working as a research intern at <a class="main-links"
                        href="https://trac-ai.iastate.edu/" target="_blank">Translational AI Center</a> at Iowa State
                    University, where I spend most days juggling between few-shot detection with Vision-Language models
                    and building a Canvas-based RAG application.</p>
                <p>I am interested in a bunch of things, but I mostly focus on Reinforcement Learning, Robotics,
                    Perception, and Large Language Models. I like exploring how machines can learn from the world, how
                    they can see, move, and reason, and what it takes to get them to do something useful outside of
                    simple benchmarks.</p>
                <p>Some of the cool stuff I have worked on includes image encryption using Reservoir Computing and
                    Fractional order Hyperchaotic Systems, multi-agent path planning, teaching a model to play games
                    like Trackmania, and tinkering with robotic arms and motorized bots.</p>
                <p>If you want to reach out, just drop me a DM. I check them often and am happy to chat or help out.</p>

                <p>Hi! I'm <a class="main-links" href="https://x.com/Nitish_singla_" target="_blank">Salty Duck</a>.</p>
                <p>I'm expected to graduate from University of Delhi by July 2026. After that, I'll finally be
                    officially unemployed (unless someone pays me to keep pretending I know what I'm doing). Somehow, I
                    managed to trick the folks at <a class="main-links" href="https://trac-ai.iastate.edu/"
                        target="_blank">Translational AI Center</a> into making me a research intern. Spoiler: I don't
                    actually research. At max, I research how to use my AI generated code to create more AI generated
                    stuff. It's called recursion, baby.</p>
                <p>I claim to care about Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, Perception, and Large Language Models. Truth
                    is, I care about whether my robot arm will will spill my chai again. The rest is just buzzwords I
                    recycle in meetings to sound smart.</p>
                <p>Some of the cooler (or dumber, depending on the day) things I've done: encrypting images with
                    Reservoir Computing chaotic systems that are more chaotic than my life, making bots pathfind without
                    crashing into each other (mostly), teaching AI to play Trackmania because I am trash at the game,
                    and wiring motorized bots that occasionally obey me—when they're in the mood.</p>
                <p>If you want to reach out, hit me up on DMs. I'll probably reply while I'm supposed to be
                    “researching.”</p>
